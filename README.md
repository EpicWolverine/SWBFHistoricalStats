Star Wars Battlefront Historical Stats
===========
Records and displays historical player counts for Star Wars Battlefront.

Uses data from [swbstats.com](http://swbstats.com). Chart powered by [Chart.js](http://chartjs.org).

Usage
===========
Run main.py to collect and record data. This will generate two files: output.csv for the master record and data.json for displaying on the web. Open index.html to view the chart.

To-Do
===========
* Make the date range adjustable.
* Hide excessive x-axis labels. This is probably dependant on [implimentation into Chart.js](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/issues/12) unless a workaround is used.
